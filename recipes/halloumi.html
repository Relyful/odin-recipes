        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I think halloumi might just be my favourite cheese ever - it truly is the king of cheeses. It's soft, it's salty, 
            it's gooey, it's crispy, it's squidgy... all at the same time. If you like the flavour of crispy cheese (and who doesn't?!), 
            you'll love fried halloumi.</p>
